    Restaurant in Shanghai
    Shanghai is an international city with not only Chinese food but food from all other countries as well. Without
    going abroad, people in Shanghai can taste almost all food they want from different countries in the world. As a
    Chinese who grew up in Shanghai, I am going to introduce you some of good restaurants, including Shnaghainese food
    restaurants and western food restaurants.

    All of restaurants that I picked for you features fancy environment, best service, and scrumptious food. You can
    find Italian restaurants with magnificent interior design and authentic Italian cuisine, which makes you feel like you
    are really in Italia. There are also some brunch restaurants for people who prefer to eat in the late morning. Last
    but not least, some Chinese restaurants that features traditional Chinese food are also included. For example, Jia
    Jia Tangbao and Yi Pin Ju are two highly rated restaurants in Shangahi. If you are interested in Chinese food or you
    are looking for good places for brunch and bars, just take a look at my website!
