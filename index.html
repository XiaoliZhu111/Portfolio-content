    Restaurant in Shanghai
    Shanghai is an international city with not only Chinese food but food from all other countries as well. Without going abroad, people in Shanghai can taste almost all food they want from different countries in the world. As a Chinese who grew up in Shanghai, I am going to introduce you some of good restaurants, including Shnaghainese food  restaurants and western food restaurants. 

    All of restaurants that I picked for you features fancy environment, best service, and scrumptious food. If you are interested in Chinese food or you are looking for good places for brunch and bars, just take a look at my website!
